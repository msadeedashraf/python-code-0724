The "Snake Water Gun" game is a classic hand game played by many people. Here are the rules:

Snake vs. Water: Snake drinks the water, so snake wins.
Water vs. Gun: The gun will drown in water, so water wins.
Gun vs. Snake: The gun kills the snake, so gun wins.
If both players choose the same object, it's a draw. You can play this game with a friend or even against the computer. Want to try it out? 😊
